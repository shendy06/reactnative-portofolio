After the car crash took her one and only sister, Lea Seto, she’s sent to Hawaii to live with her aunt by her mother. As Rumi gets used to her new surroundings, she starts to talk with her two neighbours. One of them is a boy who’s about her age, and the other is an old man, who is still trying to get past his own grief."

        description: "Eliza is not someone you would call special at first glance. She gets average grades, has an average family, and pretty much an average, 18 year old life. That is, if you ignore that she was the anonymous artist of the most popular webcomic, “Monstrous Sea”. When she starts to talk to the new boy at school, she starts to wonder if the real world could be as enjoyable as its digital counterpart. Soon afterwards, her identity is exposed, and her life starts to crumble- along with her sanity."
